# 🚀 How to Deploy Your Valentine's Website

Here are two easy ways to get your website online so you can share it with Sanjana!

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free & Easy)

Since you already have the code on GitHub (assumed, as this is a repository), this is the simplest way.

1.  Go to your repository's **Settings** tab on GitHub.
2.  Click **Pages** in the left sidebar menu.
3.  Under **Source**, select the `main` branch from the dropdown.
4.  Click **Save**.
5.  Wait a few minutes.
6.  Your site will be live at: `https://your-username.github.io/valentine-website-2026` (or whatever your repo name is).

## Option 2: Netlify (Recommended for Custom URLs)

Netlify is great if you want a custom link name like `sanjanas-valentine.netlify.app`.

1.  Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2.  Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**.
3.  Choose **GitHub**.
4.  Select your `valentine-website-2026` repository.
5.  Click **"Deploy site"**.
6.  Once deployed, click **"Domain settings"** to change the random name to something special!

## 💡 Important Tips
- **Test it first!** Open the link yourself to make sure everything looks clear and the name "Sanjana" appears correctly.
- **Mobile Check:** Look at it on your phone, as that's likely where she will open it.
